# Task-Time
A web application for todo lists that allows the user to create, save and manage tasks, as well as decide which tasks to focus on.
Expected tech stack for this personal project: Next.js, React, TailwindCSS, Prisma, and PostgreSQL.
Status: planning, learning

## Planned features:
- Basic functionalities: adding a task, deleting a task, setting due dates, listing all tasks, marking a task as done.
- 'Task Time' page: Displays all tasks as panels/boxes, with each box with a different set size depending on its urgency and importance, so the user knows what to prioritise. May require weighting of user-inputed factors to decide how big each box should appear.
- Database to store the tasks of a user.
- Batch-adding tasks.

## Possible features:
- Option to view the 'Task Time' page on a date in the future, to tell the user what will become important in the future.
- 'Smart commands' in which a user may enter a prompt detailing what they want. (e.g. Submitting "Buy milk due tomorrow" adds the task 'buy milk', due on tomorrow's date.) Could use AI or parsing of the string.
