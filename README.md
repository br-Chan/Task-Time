# Task-Time
First project using Git and GitHub - a to do list application that allows the user to create, save and manage tasks.

## Planned features:
- Basic commands in the terminal: adding a task, deleting a task, listing all tasks ("Task Time"), marking a task as done.
- Storage of tasks in a file
- Priority/Date system - allow tasks to have a due date or priority over other tasks.
- 'Smarter' commands in which a user may submit a sentence detailing what they want. (e.g. Submitting "Add buy milk due tomorrow" adds the task 'buy milk' to the file, due date listed as tomorrow.)
- Adding more than 1 task in a single command
